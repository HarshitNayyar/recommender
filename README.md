## Introduction

In the digital age, managing a library effectively is crucial. The **Recommender** microservice enhances user experience by suggesting books based on their reading history and preferences. By utilizing machine learning, this service adapts to user behavior, improving recommendations over time.

To get started, visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/HarshitNayyar/recommender/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions provided to execute the service.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Uses BERT embeddings to analyze user preferences.
- **Clustering**: Implements DBSCAN for effective grouping of similar items.
- **Django Framework**: Built with Django for easy integration and scalability.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Allows for independent deployment and management.
- **User-Friendly API**: Provides a simple interface for interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **BERT**: For understanding the context of words in user reviews.
- **Sentence Transformers**: To convert sentences into embeddings.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Django**: As the web framework for building the service.
- **DBSCAN**: A clustering algorithm used for grouping similar items.

## Installation

To set up the **Recommender** microservice, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshitNayyar/recommender.git
   cd recommender
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   Start the Django server with the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. **Access the API**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/` to interact with the API.

## Usage

After setting up the service, you can start using the API to get book recommendations. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **POST Request**: Send a POST request to `/recommend` with the user's reading history in the body. The service will return a list of recommended books.
   
   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "user_id": "123",
       "history": ["Book A", "Book B", "Book C"]
   }
   ```

2. **GET Request**: You can also fetch available books by sending a GET request to `/books`.

3. **Example Response**:
   ```json
   {
       "recommendations": ["Book D", "Book E", "Book F"]
   }
   ```
